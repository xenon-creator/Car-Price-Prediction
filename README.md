# Car-Price-Prediction
The "Car-Price-Prediction"  focuses on predicting automobile prices using a Linear Regression Model. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, car price) and one or more independent variables (features like engine size, horsepower, etc.).

Modules used:
NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them.
pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures like DataFrames, which are invaluable for handling and analyzing structured data.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: These are visualization libraries. Matplotlib provides a comprehensive range of plotting functions, while Seaborn, built on top of Matplotlib, offers a higher-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
Scikit-Learn: A robust machine learning library that offers simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It includes modules for regression, classification, clustering, and more.

The typical workflow in this **Car Price Prediction** project follows a structured approach, starting with **data loading** using **pandas**, where the dataset is read (often from a CSV file) and stored in a DataFrame for easy manipulation. Next, **data preprocessing** is performed, which includes handling missing values to ensure a complete dataset, encoding categorical variables (such as car brand or fuel type) into numerical formats, and applying feature scaling to normalize numerical features. Once the data is cleaned, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is conducted using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**, where visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots help understand data distributions and relationships between features and car price. Correlation analysis is also performed to identify the most influential factors affecting car prices.  

After EDA, the data is split into **training and testing sets**, ensuring the model is trained on one portion and evaluated on another for generalization. The **Linear Regression model** is then built using **Scikit-Learn**, where it is trained on the processed dataset. Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²)** to assess its predictive accuracy. Further, the model’s coefficients are analyzed to understand the weight of each feature in price prediction. If performance improvements are needed, **feature engineering** is performed by creating or modifying features, and **hyperparameter tuning** is explored to optimize the model’s predictive power. The final model provides a reliable estimate of car prices based on the input features, demonstrating the power of **machine learning** in the automotive domain.

This project exemplifies the application of linear regression in predicting car prices, offering insights into the factors influencing automobile valuations. By leveraging Python's data science libraries, the project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a valuable resource for those interested in machine learning applications in the automotive domain.
