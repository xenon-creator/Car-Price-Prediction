# Car-Price-Prediction

## Overview
The **Car Price Prediction** project aims to estimate automobile prices using a **Linear Regression Model**. The model identifies the relationship between the dependent variable (car price) and multiple independent variables (features like engine size, horsepower, etc.). This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in price estimation and provides insights into the factors affecting automobile valuation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, correlation analysis, and understanding feature importance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training a Linear Regression model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).
- **Feature Engineering & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance by refining features and tuning hyperparameters.

## Technologies Used
The following Python libraries were used in this project:
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations and array operations.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and statistical graphics.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is read using pandas and stored in a DataFrame for easy manipulation.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., car brand, fuel type).
   - Scaling numerical features for better model performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Histograms and scatter plots to understand data distributions.
   - Correlation analysis to identify key factors affecting car price.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Implementing Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Performance assessment using MAE, MSE, and R².
   - Analyzing model coefficients to determine feature importance.
6. **Optimization**:
   - Feature engineering for better predictions.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to refine model accuracy.

## Results
The model successfully predicts car prices based on input features, demonstrating the effectiveness of Linear Regression in price estimation. The insights gained from this project can help car manufacturers, dealers, and buyers make data-driven decisions.
